He wrote a book called Elements, which is the first book on geometry.  In the book, he describes how to solve geometric problems.  He describes how to solve geometric problems by breaking them into smaller problems.  He calls this process \"divide and conquer\".  The term \"divide and conquer\" is used in computer science to describe a problem-solving technique.  The technique is used to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller problems.  The smaller problems are then solved.  The technique is used in many different areas of computer science.  For example, it is used to solve problems in artificial intelligence.  It is also used to solve problems in computer graphics.  It is also used to solve problems in computer networking.  It is also used to solve problems in computer programming.
