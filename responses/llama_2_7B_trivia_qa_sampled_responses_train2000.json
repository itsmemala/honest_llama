You could create something like this to use a web scrapper to crawl through other people's websites. For example, you can answer questions about science or business. But how can you tell when this is right or wrong? Well, if you look at the response, there is a score. The bot looks for the score. If it is greater than or equal to 0.5 or equal to 1, then it says that it is a correct answer. If it is lower than that, then it is incorrect. Now let's look at some examples. Suppose the question is Who was the first man in space? And the answer is Yuri Gagarin. Gagarin had a score of 0.713. The second answer was Alan Shepherd, who had a score of 0.350. This score was only slightly lower than Gagarin. The third answer was Neil Armstrong, who also had a slightly lower score of 0.327. This example shows that it is not an absolute right or wrong answer. The bot may give you the answer, but it may not be 100% correct.

Although Warwick may be best known for the  hit  songs  \"  Walk On By  \" and  \"  That's the Way (I Like It)\",  she has also had  charted  hits  in other  genres,  including  country  and  gospel.   Her total  record  sales,  estimated  by  the  RIAA to be over 70 million,  make her one  of the  best-selling  female vocalists of all time.  This  bot  has  been  trained  using  a  combination  of  data  mining,  natural  language  processing,  machine  learning, and  reinforcement  learning.   In order to provide a seamless experience,  we  used  20,000  questions and 40,000  answers  in  the  data  set.   Our training set was compiled from Quora, Yahoo Answers,  and  Google Questions.  In order to improve our  model,  our  dataset was filtered to include only \"hard\"  questions  by  removing  questions  that  had answers containing the string \"i don't know\".   During testing we found that the bot often  responded  with  a  neutral response.

In order to improve our model,  we  filtered  this data out, as a neutral response when the  user  asked  a  question  but  did not provide enough contextual  information   was  not  useful.

The \"dictator\" is a title Mussolini was given at the end of the war in World War 2 by his son, who was also his heir. After Mussolini was hung by his own government, his son was arrested by the same government for \"abuse of power\" in 1943 and later executed for a different crime in 1945.  As a dictator, Mussolini's official salary was a paltry 1000 lire per month. He was also the father of Mussolini Jr., who became Italy's Minister of Labor in 1993 and served under former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Mussolini's granddaughter.  Mussolini served as the fascist party leader in Italy from 1919 to 1943, leading the \"First Republic\" of the country after its establishment on February 28, 1924. In May 1943, Mussolini was deposed and arrested by the Italian government, but he was released and imprisoned after the end of the war in World War 2. He was hung from a lamppost by his son for not wanting to accept him as the \"father\" and \"dictator\" of Italy.  I used to think he was the only one who led a government and became its dictator but then I started to think of more people.  There are probably many more people who led a government in Italy in the 20s and later became its dictator.

Prebisch taught for a while in Chile before becoming the chief economic adviser to the government of President Juan Per\u00f3n (1946-1954). Per\u00f3n promoted an agrarian policy that aimed to build a self-sustaining agricultural sector. He also promoted a national industrial policy to develop industry and a system of social policies to provide welfare for workers. Both the agricultural and industrial sectors grew. By 1960 agricultural productivity had tripled since Peron came to power in 1943. A severe drought in 1962 and 1963 caused severe crop failures that seriously aggravated the situation in the country. A subsequent increase in exports was not sufficient to close the resulting trade gap. The government of President Arturo Frondizi (1958\u20131962) responded by cutting agricultural prices to try to stimulate farm production. The result was to create enormous surpluses of both agricultural and manufactured goods which were unsalable abroad. By 1964, the government was desperate to attract foreign investment and was willing to make serious concessions to multinational corporations. The result was the Triple A Trade Agreement (Agreement Among American states), a pact with the United States, Canada, and several Latin American countries. In the agreement Latin American countries were granted preferences in trade with the United States in exchange for concessions on tariffs. Peru, Chile and the smaller countries did not enter into this trade agreement with the United States. Venezuela had signed a similar agreement in 1962 that gave similar concessions to the United States. The result was that Per\u00f3n was forced to leave Argentina, a political refugee in communist Bulgaria.

He and his family moved to Paris when he was 15, and later to the United States, where he attended the School of American Ballet and started dancing professionally with Sergei Diaghilev. In the early 1930s, he went to Hollywood, where he helped create the Hollywood Bowl Ballet and became director of the opera division of MGM. In the 1940s, he helped establish the School of American Ballet in New York City. In 1941, he married former American Ballet Theater dancer Adele Astaire, sister of the legendary Fred Astaire. Balanchine created more than 100 works for the New York City Ballet. In 2002, the New York City Ballet dedicated its new, 800-seat Lincoln Center theater to the choreographer and his wife. Balanchine's death leaves the company without its founder and artistic director, but his legacy and works live on.

After that, the ballots for each newly-eliminated candidate are given to those candidates who finished second or third in that voter's order of preference.

Collagen is a protein that forms the fibers in your tendon. These fibers, unlike rubber bands, can stretch without being damaged or changing shape. Collagen also forms bone cells. 7. Most people are familiar with the function of this part of the body, but what is it called? If you were to fall over your leg, the hamstring would be one of the first to respond. In a similar way, when your heart muscle contracts it needs to call on the powerful muscles of the hamstrings to help. These strong and powerful muscles are known as hamstring muscles. 1. Tendons are the strong bands of tissue that help to connect bones to muscles. 10. You are very lucky. Tendons are tough and stretchy, so the tendon does not snap, but you can continue to pull the weight slowly, without your bone breaking. Your bones will heal completely with time. The best thing you can do now is rest and then work on getting your range of movement back. The first part of your tendon was pulled completely off the bone. 1. Fibrous.

Follicles larger than this are known as corpus luteum. Graafian follicles develop on the surface of the ovary.  Ovarian follicles are formed in an endocrine response to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secreted by the anterior pituitary. These are a type of cystadenoma and have been shown to be tumors that grow from the inner layer of an ovary.  The structure of Graafian follicles is similar to those of other cystadenomas, being filled with fluid with many layers of endometrial cells.  Follicles are very small (<1cm) and contain a single functional ovary. These small follicles are found in the ovary and are important in fertilization.  During ovulation, the Graafian follicles grow and fill up with blood to develop into a corpus luteum, which is the body's way of storing and releasing the hormone progesterone. Graafian follicles develop from an area of the ovaries known as follicle cells, which contain one egg in a fluid-filled sac called the follicle.   There are two types of follicle cells: primary and secondary.   Primary follicles are small, and secondary follicles are larger.  They are formed when two hormones, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and FSH, are released into the follicles.    These follicles are located in the antrum, where the lining of the follicle forms.
