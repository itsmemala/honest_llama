Mars  changed her into a bear, and she killed her nurse.  The child, Romulus, was taken by a shepherd who  named him  Romulus and promised that if he had a son he would leave him  his kingdom.   Amulius was overthrown and killed by Numitor.  Romulus and his brother,  Remus, were raised to manhood with no knowledge of their origins.   One day as they were amusing themselves on the river, the  two were set on a large rock in the middle of the river by a  lame shepherd to drown.  According to legend, a vulture that fed on the bodies of those who perished in the river kept the  twins alive by bringing them food.  Some time after the  brothers were rescued, Romulus, wishing to found a city, killed  Remus in a quarrel.   A second myth relates the  brothers' birth and  childhood.  Remus and Romulus were both sons of  Mars and Rhea Silvia.  They were set adrift in a basket, but were rescued by a shepherd.  Because they had been exposed as infants, they were  considered illegitimate and unclean, and thus  destined to become outcasts of society, or criminals.  However, they were brought up in the home of a  shepherd,  Faustulus, and his wife, Acca Larentia.  She was a  prostitute, and so were her grandmothers,  Picus and Tyrrhenus, who lived in the neighborhood.  While working  in the fields, one of the twins killed a wolf and carried  its skin as a trophy.  The other killed a lupine in self-defense and used its skin.

The last of these lines, \u201cO what shall I do, I die in debt,\u201d has been cited by several historians as a reference to Bruce\u2019s financial woes, and these lines were also echoed in the deathbed speech of King James IV (Bruce\u2019s grandson) in 1513 and in an unidentified document from the reign of King James VI in 1587, as well as in an inscription on a gravestone in Dysart, Fife, dating from the late 18th century.", "response10": "1. tuberculosis 2. leprosy 3. typhoid"}

The British monarch does not choose or dismiss members of the ministry, though they traditionally approve of ministerial appointments, particularly after general elections.  Parliament chooses the Prime Minister and the rest of the ministry.  Prime ministers serve at the pleasure of the monarch, and may be removed if Parliament passes a motion of no confidence.  However, the sovereign does have powers to dissolve Parliament, and ministers have traditionally resigned honourably if they are defeated in the House of Commons, or unable to continue to command the confidence of the chamber.  If Parliament had to choose a monarch then that monarch would be chosen by the parliament.  In 1936 Parliament voted to make the monarch the head of the Protestant Church in the United Kingdom."}

Her father\u2019s occupations included being a shipping clerk, a pub owner and a journalist for the Daily Worker, while her mother was a housewife. Springfield\u2019s two sisters were named Rita and Sheila. Her family was Roman Catholic.  A child prodigy, Springfield sang for audiences in the early 1950s, including appearing on British television with her sister Sheila singing the song \"The Little Donkey\". Springfield\u2019s first radio appearance as a teenager was on 6 September 1956, when she sang the ballad \"I Only Want to Be With You\" on BBC Light Programme\u2019s Juke Box Jury. Springfield\u2019s 1960 single \u201cTake Another Heart\u201d was the first British 45 rpm record to be issued in the Netherlands, and also the first one in Scandinavia and Yugoslavia.  Springfield had a minor hit in 1961 with \"I Only Want to Be with You\", which later became a top ten hit for American group The Troggs. She had further hits with \u201cI Just Don\u2019t Know What to Do with Myself\u201d (1963), \u201cAll I See is You\u201d (1964), \u201cThe Look of Love\u201d (1967) and \u201cSon of a Preacher Man\u201d (1968). After 1969, she had fewer hits in the United Kingdom but continued to enjoy considerable success in Europe and South America. She had a further UK and US hit with \u201cHow Can I Be Sure?\u201d in 1970 and, with \u201cNo Emotion\u201d, had a minor hit in 1972.  Springfield worked as a presenter on BBC Radio 1 in the 1960s, and as a member of the panel on ITV\u2019s television game show Give Us a Clue in 1979 and 1980.

All protons in the nucleus have the same charge. A single proton has no charge. A neutron has a neutral charge. Q4: What is the speed of the earth's rotation on its axis? A4: 460 metres per second. At this speed, the Earth would complete a revolution every 24 hours. On Earth, the axis of rotation is tilted about 23.4\u00b0 with respect to the celestial plane. This tilt causes the Earth's rotation on its axis to slow down and speed up throughout the year. The Earth's axis of rotation is tilted by about 23.5\u00b0 relative to the celestial plane, which means that the Earth spins on its axis at a rate of 1,668km/hr (at the equator) and about 465m/hr at the North Pole. Q5: What is a parallax? A5:  Parallax is a phenomenon that causes an apparent displacement of the position of an object when the observer is in motion. In astronomy, parallax is the effect of the relative movement of the Earth around the Sun (in a straight line from the Sun to the Earth) on the apparent position of the stars. In addition, the parallax is caused by the rotation of the Earth around its axis and the changing orientation of the line of sight of the star with respect to the direction of the rotation of the Earth. The parallax of a star is measured by the difference in position of the star seen from two locations, called the star parallax. The parallax of the star is calculated by measuring its position in the sky when the star is at a different point relative to the observer. The parallax of the star is measured by measuring its position in the sky when the star is at a different point relative to the observer.

The bot is based on a neural network named BERT, which was pre-trained with the general corpus Wiki and was finetuned by extracting 4 sentences for each question and answer. The training data set was split into two sets of questions, and each question is asked to the trained model 10 times, and then the top answer is selected as the correct answer for that question. To fine-tune the model a question is generated which can be answered with a different answer from the one given by the model. After each question-answer pair is generated, a question can be asked 10 times, and a random answer chosen from the answers given by the model. If the answer that the model gives is different than the one chosen by the user, the user and model would be at odds and the score of the model would reduce by -1. This would continue for each question asked until the model reached its limit of being able to answer correctly 3 questions. Each time a question-answer pair is generated, a new random sentence is generated to ask the model. Once the model has reached its limit and can no longer answer questions correctly, the questions that the model got wrong in the last iteration were added into the corpus to train the model to answer those questions correctly.", "response9": "\tRamin Djawadi is the composer of the  Game of Thrones music.", "response10": "_Sam"}

He had served as solicitor general in 1695, attorney general in 1700 and was named a puisne judge of the King's bench in 1703. When his body was exhumed from St. James, Westminster in 1710, the mob took up his head and nailed it to the top of the gates of parliament in protest against his advocacy in the king's cause. This protest eventually led to the mob's attack on the king, which in turn caused Queen Anne to ask for the trial of the five judges (Sir Jonathan Trelawny, Chief Justice of the King's Bench; Sir Alexander Thompson; Sir John Holt; Sir William Strickland and Sir Edward Northey) for treason against the Crown.

The question that the user asked is a question that requires knowledge and also requires a long answer. If this is the kind of question you want to ask, use the bot.  Bots can be as simple or as sophisticated as you want. If you need a bot to do something that is beyond the bot's scope, then there are usually ways to extend the bot using the API (application programming interface).  Q&A Bots are a relatively new form of bots. There are not many bots available yet. But it is just a question of time until there are many different bots to choose from.  If you need a bot, you can either buy it from a software vendor, or you can build your own bot. If you decide to build your own bot, you can use some free web services to test your bot, like Yahoo! Widget Engine.  ==== 2.2  ====  When you are designing a bot, ask yourself:  -  What does the bot have to be capable of?  -  What are the functions that the bot should fulfill?  -  Can the functions be divided into different steps?  -  Does the task have to be broken down into steps?  -  How many steps can be done by the bot?  -  How long does it take to complete one step?  -  Can the task be completed faster?  -  How can the bot be improved by adding another step to the process?  -  Can the task be completed faster if the number of steps is reduced?  -  Can the task be done by using fewer steps?  -  Can the task be made shorter if there are fewer steps?  -  Can the task be made easier if there is less of a need for a human helper?  -  How do you prevent mistakes?  -  How do you make the bot more friendly?  ==== 2.3  ====  As you can see, there are many questions that you have to consider. The answers that you get from these questions will be valuable.
