{"prompt": "This is a bot that correctly answers questions. \n Q: Which famous book, published in 1816, is sub-titled The Modern Prometheus? A: ", "response1": "Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus, is a novel written by English author Mary Shelley about the young student of science Victor Frankenstein, who creates a grotesque creature in an unorthodox scientific experiment.  Shelley started writing the story when she was 18, and the novel was published when she was 20.  The first edition was published anonymously in London in 1818.  Shelley's name appears on the second edition, published in France in 1823.  The Modern Prometheus is a reference to the myth of Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods and gave it to humanity.  The novel has had a seminal influence on science fiction as we know it today.  It was also a moral warning against the consequences of scientific and intellectual hubris.  The novel is told from a frame narrative as Victor relates the tale of his unnatural creation to Walton, the book's protagonist.  Victor's creation is a savage, mindless being that, over time, comes to learn and speak.  The monster is initially delighted with his new life, but as he witnesses the happiness of mankind, he becomes insane with jealousy and hatred.  He is eventually driven away by the disgust of all he meets.  Victor later hears of the monster's murderous rampage in Europe and realizes that it was his creation.  He sets off in search of his monster, intending to kill it.  However, upon finding it, he is overcome with remorse and decides not to kill it.  The monster then kills itself.  Victor is left to die in the Arctic, but he is rescued by Walton and his crew.  Victor then writes a final letter to his sister, in which he details his life story and expresses his regret for creating the monster.  The novel is divided into three volumes.  The first volume is set in Geneva, Switzerland, where the story opens with the creation of the monster.  The second volume is set in the mountains of Switzerland and Italy, where Victor and the monster meet.  The third volume is set in the Arctic Ocean, where Victor is rescued by Walton and his crew.  The novel is written in a style that blends Gothic horror"}
