In 2 Kings 6:17, the prophet Elisha is praying to God for help. When some boys see him praying, they make fun of him. Elisha replies, \"You shall see it with your eyes, but you shall not eat of it.\" In other words, you will see what I am praying for but you will not enjoy it. This story is symbolic of what prayer warriors do. They fight spiritual battles in the heavenly realms so that those - whom they love - on earth do not have to face them.\n\nComment: Welcome to EL&U.

It was created on December 23, 1913, with the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act, after a series of financial panics (particularly the panic of 1907) led to the desire for central banking in the United States.  The Federal Reserve System is a privately owned central bank that is responsible for managing the nation's money supply and interest rates. The Federal Reserve is not part of the government. It is an independent agency that was created by Congress to provide the nation with a safer, more flexible, and more stable monetary and financial system. Over the years, its role in monetary policy has expanded. It now supervises and regulates banking institutions to ensure the safety and soundness of the nation's banking system. It also serves as the government's banker, providing financial services to the U.S. Treasury.  The Federal Reserve is not part of the government.
